SwipeNavigationController is a Snapchat like 4-way swipe navigation in Swift for iOS

Feel free to contribute by submiting PRs!

# Installation
If install using cocoapods, include this in your pod file and run ```pod install```:
## Swift 3.0:
```ruby
pod 'SwipeNavigationController', '~> 2.0.0'
```
## Swift 2.3:
```ruby
pod 'SwipeNavigationController', '~> 1.1.0'
```

Carthage is currently not supported.


# Usage
In your code, ```import SwipeNavigationController```, and create a SwipeNavigationController that enables 4 directions swipe navigation: 
```swift
let swipeNavigationController = SwipeNavigationController(centerViewController: CenterViewController())
swipeNavigationController.topViewController = TopViewController()
swipeNavigationController.bottomViewController = BottomViewController()
swipeNavigationController.leftViewController = LeftViewController()
swipeNavigationController.rightViewController = RightViewController()
```
Setting of view controllers value for all directions are optional. View controller set for respective direction will enable swipe by default, to disable swipe for direction use:
```swift
swipeNavigationController.shouldShowTopViewController = false
swipeNavigationController.shouldShowBottomViewController = false
swipeNavigationController.shouldShowLeftViewController = false
swipeNavigationController.shouldShowRightViewController = false
```
To show embedded view controller manually without using the gesture, in your center view controller use:
```swift
self.containerSwipeNavigationController.showEmbeddedView(.top)
self.containerSwipeNavigationController.showEmbeddedView(.bottom)
self.containerSwipeNavigationController.showEmbeddedView(.left)
self.containerSwipeNavigationController.showEmbeddedView(.right)
```
To receive callback when the embedded view moves to new position, your view controller will need to conform to SwipeNavigationControllerDelegate and implement the following functions:
```swift
/// Callback when embedded view started moving to new position
func swipeNavigationController(_ controller: SwipeNavigationController, willShowEmbeddedViewForPosition position: Position) {
}

/// Callback when embedded view had moved to new position
func swipeNavigationController(_ controller: SwipeNavigationController, didShowEmbeddedViewForPosition position: Position) {
}
```
